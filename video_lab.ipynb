    "NASA wants to go to Mars! Before they build their rocket, NASA needs to track information about all of the planets in the Solar System. Use SQL to help NASA create, alter, and insert data into a database that stores all of this important information. Then practice querying the database with various SELECT statements. We will select different columns, and employ other SQL clauses like WHERE to return the data we would like.\n",

For example, when you start to write your own re-usable code for cleaning up data you might well decide to create some Python files that you can access from and share between different Notebooks. **\n",
